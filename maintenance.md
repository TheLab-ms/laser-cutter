# Maintenance

## Regular maintenance

Make sure to perform the following every 3 months:

* Clean laser mirrors
* Clean linear bearings


## Replacement Parts

* Laser Tube: https://www.ebay.com/itm/EFR-ZN-ZS1250-80W-CO2-Sealed-Laser-Tube-US-Stock/183439121099
  * NOTE:  This tube was slightly bigger than the original laser tube, which caused numerous calibration problems.

## Cleaning

### Linear bearings

The Y-axis runs on a linear bearing.  Here's a video on cleaning them:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c53sa46C1qQ

If there is a rust build-up (oxidation), you can buff it out with Scotch Brite.

It was recommended to not use grease, because it can collect dust.

## Calibrating Mirrors

This is often a slow and tedious process.  When calibrating the mirrors, do in this order:

* Mirror closest to the laser
* Y-Axis mirror
* X-Axis mirror

To determine if the mirror is aligned, add a piece of tape to the front of a piece of paper to easily tell where the beam it hitting.

_NOTE: There might be a better way of doing this, but since it's a repeated process, we wanted something we could easily throw away to re-test with fresh materials._
